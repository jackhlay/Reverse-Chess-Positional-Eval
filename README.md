Hello, thank you for your interest
This a machine learning project using Positional Eval data from Stockfish.
The final csv itself was too large to upload, due to formatting fen strings as 2d arrays representing the board. The process can be seen in the notebook though.
This uses a CNN to analayze the positions represented by arrays.
