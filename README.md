****Chess Position Evaluator using a Neural Newtork****

Welcome to my chess position evaluator project! This machine learning project uses positional evaluation data from Stockfish to predict the evaluation of random chess positions.  

Overview
The goal of this project was to build a neural network using Keras and Tensorflow that could take in a chess position and return a predicted evaluation. To achieve this, I sourced positional evaluation data from Stockfish, which was used to train the model.  
  
Methodology
To clean the data and format the FEN strings as arrays representing the board, I followed a specific process that can be seen in the accompanying Jupyter notebook. However, due to the size of the final CSV file, it was not possible to upload it to GitHub.  
  
Results
After training the model, I was able to achieve (placeholder) level of accuracy in predicting the evaluation of random chess positions. The project was both challenging and rewarding, and allowed me to hone my skills in machine learning, Python programming, and deep learning.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out.
